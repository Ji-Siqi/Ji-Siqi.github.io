Maverick is a static blog generator built with python. Like Hexo and Jekyll, it takes Markdown(`.md`) files as input, and output beautifully formated and well structured website pages(`.html`). It has a lot built-in useful features(feed, search, sitemap, etc.), with extended Markdown syntax and enhanced image processing pipeline.

If you are tired of intricate plugins and complicated configurations, just give Maverick a try. You focus on writing, let Maverick take care of the rest.
